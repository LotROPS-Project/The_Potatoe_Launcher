The launcher for the LotROPS Project


# About the Potatoe Launcher
The Potatoe Launcher is intended to be a way the LotROPS Project players can check for updates, download new components, see project announcements,  and/or launch the game easily and in a ingenuitive way using the Godot engine as the foundation and for the UI (mainly just because I want an excuse to learn how to use Godot).

In simple terms though, basically the Potatoe Launcher will query say, Github to see if there have been any new releases and will then tell the user and ask if they would like to download anything (if there's anything to download anyway).
